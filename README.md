# CV/Resume Application

This is my first full React project, built after formally learning about React concepts like **state**, **lifting state up**, and **component-based architecture**. While I had used React before, this is the first time I built something with a solid understanding of how React works under the hood.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this project was to solidify my understanding of:

- Managing local component state
- Lifting state up to share data between components
- Handling form input and updates
- Passing props effectively

This project isn't intended to be perfect or production-ready â€” it's primarily a **learning exercise** to put my new React skills into practice.
